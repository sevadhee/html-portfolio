<h1>The Best Movies According to Sevadhee.</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Percy Jackson</h3>

<p>The is my favourite movie because it perfectly exemplifies greek mythology.<br/> The movie is set in an amazing theme and I would highly recommond people to watch it. </p>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>

<p>Similarly to Percy Jackson, Harry potter has a mythical theme that enchants readers as they watch the movie. This movie provides a lot of engagement as it is suitable for all ages. </p>

<h3>The Incredibles</h3>

<p>This is a hilarious family movie that is based on superpowers. It shows that though supers, they still have the problems of a normal family.</p>
